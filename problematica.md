## Missconceptions


Separate DevOps Team:

> In the last radar issue we advised against creating a separate DevOps team, as DevOps is about creating a culture of shared responsibility in delivery teams.  We recommend embedding operations skills into delivery teams to reduce friction and deliver better outcomes.  However where there is a need for significant investment in tooling and automation, we do see a role for a Delivery Engineering team.  Rather than being a helpdesk, these teams build tooling and enable teams to deploy, monitor, and maintain their own production environments.
