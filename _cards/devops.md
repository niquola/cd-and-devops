> Some companies with good intentions create a separate DevOps team,
>  which misconstrues the definition of DevOps. Rather than a role,
> DevOps is a cultural movement encouraging collaboration between operations specialists and developers. Rather than create yet another silo and suffer
> the consequences of Conway's Law, we advise you to embed these skills into teams,
> improving feedback loops and communication pathways by removing friction.


> In the last radar issue we advised against creating a separate DevOps team,
> as DevOps is about creating a culture of shared responsibility in delivery teams.
> We recommend embedding operations skills into delivery teams to reduce friction and deliver better outcomes.
> However where there is a need for significant investment in tooling and automation,
> we do see a role for a Delivery Engineering team.  Rather than being a helpdesk,
> these teams build tooling and enable teams to deploy, monitor, and maintain their own
> production environments.
