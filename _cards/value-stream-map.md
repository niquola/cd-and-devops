## Value Stream Mapping (Value Chain)

> Value stream mapping is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer. At Toyota, it is known as "material and information flow mapping".[1] It can be applied to nearly any value chain.

> Value Stream Maps exist for two purposes: to help organizations identify and end wasteful activities.

1. Planning and preparation.
Identify the target product family or service. Create a charter,
define the problem, set the goals and objectives,
and select the mapping team.
Socialize the charter with the leadership team.

2. Draw while on the shop floor a current state value stream map,
which shows the current steps, delays, and information flows required to deliver the target product or service.
This may be a production flow (raw materials to consumer) or a design flow (concept to launch).
There are 'standard'[citation needed] symbols for representing supply chain entities.

3. Assess the current state value stream map in terms of creating flow by eliminating waste.

4. Draw a future state value stream map.

5. Work toward the future state condition
