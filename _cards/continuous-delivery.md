title:  "Continuous Delivery"

Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software
in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.

You are doing continuous delivery when:

* Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
* Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new features
* Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them
* You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand


> It's hard enough for software developers to write code that works on their machine.
> But even when that's done, there's a long journey from there to software that's producing value
> - since software only produces value when it's in production.
